# TooMuchMilk

## For students
Just my implemention of [cs162](https://cs162.eecs.berkeley.edu/) homework. Did not pass any autograder test. So, meh.

## For Employer
Implementations of some stuff for [Pintos](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html) in C. Specs are in each of their respected folders.
* HW0: Implement `wc`, or "word count", a shell command that counts lines and characters from files or STDIO.
* HW1: Implement a basic shell. Program execution, path resolution, IO redirection, interrupt signal handling and backgroud processing are supported.
* HW2: Implement a basic HTTP server. It can be a basic web server that serves static files or a proxy server and capable of serving multiple clients at once. Locks, conditional variables, and thread pooling were used to ensure the server won't crash while doing some fancy multi-threading dance.
* HW3: Implement `malloc` that allocate memory from heap for programs using first-fit algorithm. `free` and `realloc` were implemented as well for sure.
